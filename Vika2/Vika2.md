# Chapter 2: Operating System Structures

This chapter delves into system components, including user interfaces, command-line interfaces (CLIs), peripherals, and more.

## 2.2 User Interfaces of Operating Systems

Everything within a computer that a user can interact with, including processes, CLIs, search bars, and desktops, is considered a user interface. A user interface is a system that allows the user to execute commands within the operating system.

### Types of User Interfaces
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - User-friendly graphical interface based on a desktop metaphor.
   - Utilizes icons, windows, and menus, often navigated with a mouse or touch gestures.
   - Examples: Microsoft Windows, macOS Aqua GUI, Linux with Gnome or KDE.

2. **Batch Interface:**
   - Executes pre-defined scripts or commands line by line.
   - No user interaction after processing starts.

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
   - Allows direct command entry via the keyboard.
   - Outputs simple text responses on a terminal.
   - Commands may be built into the shell or external programs executed in new processes.

All these interfaces execute system calls to communicate with the operating systemâ€™s middleware. These services include program execution, I/O operations, file systems, resource allocation, error detection, and more.

## 2.3 System Calls

System calls provide a programmatic interface for services provided by the OS, typically implemented as software interrupts (traps) callable via assembly-language instructions. 

### Common APIs
- **Windows API:** Libraries available for major Microsoft programming languages.
- **POSIX API:** For UNIX-like systems, including Mac OS X and Linux. 
- **Standard C Library:** Provides OS-independent APIs for common services.
- **Java API:** Offers an OS-independent interface for the Java Virtual Machine.

### How System Calls Work
1. **Number Association:**
   - Each system call is associated with a unique number, identifying its routine in the OS kernel.

2. **API Invocation:**
   - APIs invoke system calls in the OS kernel, passing the number and parameters using a trap instruction.

3. **Parameter Passing Methods:**
   - **CPU Registers:** Parameters passed in registers (limited by their number).
   - **Block/Table:** Parameters stored in memory and a pointer is passed.
   - **Stack:** Parameters pushed onto the stack, with no limit on number or length.

### API vs. ABI
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** Used by high-level programming languages.
- **ABI (Application Binary Interface):** Defines the interface at the machine code level.

## 2.4 Types of System Calls

Six major categories:
1. **Process Control:** Manage processes (e.g., create, terminate, wait, signal).
2. **File Management:** Handle files (e.g., read, write, open, close).
3. **Device Management:** Access and manage devices.
4. **Information Maintenance:** Retrieve and modify system data.
5. **Communications:** Enable inter-process communication.
6. **Protection:** Ensure secure access to system resources.

## 2.5 System Programs/System Services

System programs provide a convenient environment for development and execution, often serving as user interfaces to system calls.

### Categories:
- **File Management:** Create, delete, copy, and manipulate files.
- **Status Information:** Retrieve system info (e.g., memory usage, date/time).
- **File Modification:** Text editors, search tools, and text transformation utilities.
- **Programming Support:** Compilers, assemblers, and debuggers.
- **Program Execution:** Loaders and shells.
- **Communications:** Tools for messaging and remote file access.
- **Application Programs:** Specific tools like word processors or games.
- **Background Programs (Daemons):** E.g., print spoolers, logging, and cron jobs.

## 2.6 Operating System Design and Implementation

Operating systems are implemented based on specific goals and mechanisms:

### Design Goals
- **User Goals:** Convenience, reliability, safety, and speed.
- **System Goals:** Simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and efficiency.

### Policy vs. Mechanism
- Policies dictate what will be done, while mechanisms implement how it is done.
- Example: CPU scheduling policy (e.g., multitasking) vs. the scheduler mechanism.

### Implementation Languages
- **Higher-Level Languages:** E.g., C for portability.
- **Assembly:** For critical tasks like context switching.

### Structures
- **Monolithic Systems:** Simple, with no strict separation between layers.
- **Layered Systems:** Hierarchical but slower due to inter-layer communication.
- **Microkernel Systems:** Minimal kernel, with additional functionality in user space.
- **Module-Based Systems:** Kernel with dynamically loadable modules.
